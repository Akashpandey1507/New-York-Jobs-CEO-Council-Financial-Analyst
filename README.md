## Background information
Your vice president sends you an Excel template containing BigTechCompany's quarterly financial statements and a PowerPoint template to complete. Your task is to prepare tables on the company's financials and to present your analysis in a PowerPoint presentation.

### Financial metrics: revenue, operating income (EBITDA), net income, and free cash flow, EBITDA margin and debt/EBITDA.

### Result: What trends do you see in the company's financials? Is the company stable, or is it in decline? Are there any red flags that would make this company high risk?

### Guide: Your bank wants to avoid companies with negative free cash flow and unhealthy leverage ratios.

### Key Terms:
* Financial statements: A company's core financial statements are the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows.
* Revenue: The money earned by a company in exchange for providing goods and services.
* Operating income (EBITDA): The amount of profit a company makes from its operations. This is calculated by subtracting operating expenses from revenue. EBITDA stands for “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.”
* Net income: A company's earnings after paying operating expenses, taxes, and interest. Free cash flow: The amount of cash a company has available to pay its debtors and/or its equity shareholders.
* EBITDA margin: A metric of a company's profitability. This is calculated by dividing a company's operating income (a.k.a. EBITDA) by revenue.
* Debt/EBITDA: A metric of a company's leverage. This is calculated by dividing a company's debt by its EBITDA.
* Leverage ratios: Metrics that provide insight into a company's debt relative to its earnings. A company with high leverage ratios may run into difficulty with making debt payments.
